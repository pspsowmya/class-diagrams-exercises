# class-diagrams-exercises

About the project: 
This project has an exercise which has been implemented to fulfil the requirement of school to manage grades of students for the Mathematics class. We can input the grades of students to the system and it has following features :
1. Each student has a name, grade, group and a secretNickName. 
2. The school will be able to get student grade and student name securely. But the secretNickName is not accesseible to the school. 
3. The school has upgrade and downgrade methods where an upgrade results in upgrading the grade of a student and downgrade results in downgrading the grade of a student. 

Project Structure:
There are two packages in the project folder. 
The App package has the main class called School which has the main method inside it. We can run the application using this class. 
The model package has Student class with all the required methods, Grade class which has all the grade values represented as an enum data type.
This project has a ClassDiagram included outside the packages folder.
